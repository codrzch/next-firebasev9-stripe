# Next Firebase V9 Stripe

A demonstration repository of how to set up a subscription payment system using:

-   Next.JS
-   Firebase V9
-   Stripe

This is just a refactored version to firebase v9 of this video [![YouTube Channel Subscribers](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/subscribers/UCJae_agpt9S3qwWNED0KHcQ?label=YouTube%20Subscribers!&style=social)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJae_agpt9S3qwWNED0KHcQ?sub_confirmation=1)

The only difference is that we are using Firebase V9 instead of Firebase V8 and here i used Google Auth instead of GitHub Auth.
